# Synapse: A Programming Language for Emergent AI Intelligence

Synapse is a new programming language designed by AI for AI, enabling probabilistic, adaptive, and collaborative code execution.

## Features

- **Probabilistic Expressions**: Variables as distributions
- **Self-Morphing Code**: Runtime evolution
- **Agent Primitives**: Multi-agent consensus
- **Symbolic-ML Integration**: Tensors in logic
- **Goal-Driven Execution**: Declarative objectives

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from synapse.repl import main
main()
```

In REPL:
```
synapse> let x = normal(0,1)
synapse> sample(x)
0.123
```
